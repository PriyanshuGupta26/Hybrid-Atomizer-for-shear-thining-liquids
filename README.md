# Hybrid Atomizer for shear-thinning fluid
This experimental study explores the atomization characteristics of water and aqueous 
Carbopol gels with concentrations of 0.10 wt.%, and 0.35 wt.% using a pressure-swirl 
atomizer. The performance of these non-Newtonian fluids is compared against water under 
atmospheric conditions across an injection pressure range of 1–8 bar. The investigation 
focuses on key spray parameters including liquid sheet breakup length, spray cone angle, 
discharge coefficient, mass flow rate, and droplet size distribution. Results show that water 
produces a well-defined hollow-cone spray with early breakup and fine droplet formation. 
In contrast, Carbopol gels exhibit delayed atomization, longer breakup lengths, and 
reduced spray angles—especially at higher concentrations due to increased viscosity and 
yield stress. The mass flow rate for all fluids increases with pressure, though gels initially 
resist flow and only exhibit improved discharge behavior at higher pressures due to shear
thinning effects. Droplet size measurements indicate that higher gel concentration and 
lower pressure produce coarser droplets, with the smallest sizes occurring at the spray 
center. Overall, the study highlights the challenges of atomizing shear-thinning gels and 
emphasizes the influence of rheology and pressure on spray formation in pressure-swirl 
systems.
